Mapping
=====

+ Pick your mapper:
  + What kind of study are you doing? What would be the downstream analyses?
  + Do you need a reference? Should it be the genome?
    + Where can you find it?
    + Is it in the correct format? How can you change it?
  + What are your reads caracteristics?


+ Preparation of the reads
  + Do they need a preprocessing (demultiplexing)?
  + What is their quality?
